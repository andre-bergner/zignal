This repository is a playground for experimental libraries around DSP
and data flow modelling. It currently contains two independent sub-projects.

## Flowz

[Flowz](flowz/README.md) is a C++ EDSL for describing dsp structures or flow-graphs.


## Reactive Expressions

[Reactive Expressions](reactive_equations/README.md) is a little C++ tool to model
dependency graphs of expressions at compile time and allow to update them efficiently.
